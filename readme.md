# ZMON OpenTracing

This project enables vendor agnostic support on ZMON's Java/Spring components.


## Features

It uses Spring Auto Configuration making it very easy to wire on Spring Boot applications.
It uses a NoOp Tracer by default and it's easy to extend with other OT implementations (LightStep, Jaeger, etc)
